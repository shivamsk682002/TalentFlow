# TalentFlow ‚Äì Mini Hiring Platform

A lightweight hiring workflow platform built with **React + Vite**, using  
**React Router**, **Dexie (IndexedDB)** for persistence, and  
**MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API simulation.  

This project demonstrates a mini-ATS (Applicant Tracking System) where jobs, candidates, and assessments can be managed in a production-like environment without a real backend.
